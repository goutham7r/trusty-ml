# Fall 2018 Independent Study under Prof. Aws Albarghouthi

### Exploring the possibilities of making machine learning more transparent, interpretable and trustworthy

* [DUTI1.0](https://github.com/goutham7r/trusty-ml/tree/master/DUTI1.0): Contains MATLAB code relating to the paper on Training Set Debugging (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/DUTI/)
* [HarryPotter.py](https://github.com/goutham7r/trusty-ml/blob/master/HarryPotter.py): Simulates the dataset from the above paper in python
* [experiments.py](https://github.com/goutham7r/trusty-ml/blob/master/experiments.py): For running experiments on the above dataset. Currently looking at unsupervised clustering for ensuring that 'trusted' data points are classified correctly by the model
* [plotting.py](https://github.com/goutham7r/trusty-ml/blob/master/plotting.py): For visualization of the dataset, clustering and training boundary
